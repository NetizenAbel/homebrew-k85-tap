===================

Casks of this tap are for apps that I work on or frequently need. 
> **IMPORTANT:** They are generally unsigned,
so you will need to allow the apps in your security settings.

Usage
=====

After you have installed `homebrew-cask`, add this tap to the list of your `homebrew` tap sources:
```
brew tap kashaiahyah85/homebrew-k85-tap
```
You now have access to install casks from here just as you would from the official project:
```
brew cask install time-to-leave
```
